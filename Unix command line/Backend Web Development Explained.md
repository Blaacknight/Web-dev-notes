# Full-Stack Web Development: Backend Introduction

## Backend Overview
The backend handles the logic and data processing for web applications. It consists of three main components:

1. **Server** - A computer that listens for requests and responds accordingly.
2. **Application** - The logic that processes requests and returns appropriate responses.
3. **Database** - Stores and retrieves data persistently.

## Frontend vs Backend
- **Frontend**: UI elements (buttons, forms, styles) that users interact with.
- **Backend**: Processes requests, runs application logic, and interacts with the database.

### Example: User Login Flow
1. User enters email and password.
2. Request sent to server → processed by application.
3. Application verifies credentials with the database.
4. If valid, sends the homepage; else, returns an error.

## Web Applications vs Static Websites
- **Static Websites**: Serve pre-defined HTML, CSS, JS files (e.g., GitHub Pages).
- **Web Applications**: Handle dynamic requests, process logic, and interact with databases.

## Analogy: Restaurant Model
- **Frontend** → Restaurant (UI the user sees).
- **Server** → Kitchen (Processes requests).
- **Application** → Chef (Executes logic).
- **Database** → Pantry (Stores data).

When a user makes a request, the server processes it, retrieves necessary data, executes logic, and sends the appropriate response back to the frontend.
