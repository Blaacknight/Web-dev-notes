# Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is an **asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime** designed to build **scalable network applications**.

### Key Features:
- Uses **JavaScript** outside the browser.
- Built on the **V8 engine** (Chrome's JavaScript engine written in C++).
- **Asynchronous & Non-blocking**.
- **Fast and scalable**.
- **Single language for full-stack development**.

## Why Use Node.js?
1. **JavaScript Everywhere**
   - Use JavaScript for both **frontend** and **backend**.
2. **High Performance**
   - Runs on **Google's V8 engine**.
   - Uses **non-blocking, event-driven architecture**.
3. **Large Ecosystem**
   - Access thousands of open-source modules via **npm (Node Package Manager)**.
4. **Scalability**
   - Great for handling large-scale applications.
5. **Industry Adoption**
   - Used by companies like **Netflix, LinkedIn, Twitter, NASA, and more**.

## Asynchronous & Event-Driven Architecture
- Traditional synchronous operations block execution until the process is complete.
- Node.js **frees up resources** by handling events asynchronously.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  console.log("Ordering Amazon package...");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Package delivered!");
  }, 3000);
  console.log("Doing other tasks while waiting...");
  ```
  **Output:**
  ```
  Ordering Amazon package...
  Doing other tasks while waiting...
  Package delivered!
  ```

## Node.js vs Other Backend Technologies
| Feature        | Node.js       | Python (Flask/Django) | PHP  | C# (.NET) |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|------|---------|
| Language    | JavaScript   | Python               | PHP  | C#      |
| Performance | Fast (V8)    | Moderate             | Slower | Fast   |
| Scalability | High        | Moderate             | Low   | High   |
| Async Support | Built-in | Limited               | No    | Yes    |
| Community   | Large       | Large                 | Declining | Large |
