# JavaScript: The Language that Powers the Web

## Introduction
Welcome to this module on **JavaScript**, the language that powers the web.

## A Brief History of Web Browsers
- Early browsers:
  - **Mosaic**: The first web browser, developed by Marc Andreessen.
  - **Netscape Navigator**: Dominated the market in the 90s with over **80% market share**.
  - **Internet Explorer vs. Netscape**: The **browser wars** led to Netscape's decline, but its technology influenced **Firefox**.

## The Birth of JavaScript
- Before JavaScript, websites were **static** and relied on servers for computations.
- Netscape envisioned a more **dynamic web** with **real-time interactions**.
- They hired **Brendan Eich**, who created JavaScript in just **10 days**.

## The Impact of JavaScript
- Disabling JavaScript affects the web experience:
  - **Twitter**: No character count feature.
  - **The New York Times**: No ads due to JavaScript-based ad loading.
  - **YouTube & Netflix**: Won't load without JavaScript.
- JavaScript has become **indispensable** for modern web applications.

## JavaScript vs. Java
- **JavaScript was originally called LiveScript**.
- Microsoft created a variant called **JScript**.
- **ECMAScript (ES)**: Standardized JavaScript by the **European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)**.
- **Java ≠ JavaScript**:
  - JavaScript is **interpreted**, while Java is **compiled**.
  - The name "JavaScript" was a **marketing strategy** to ride the Java wave.

## The Role of JavaScript in Web Development
- JavaScript acts as a **scripting language**, similar to a **script for actors**.
- HTML elements are like "actors" (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`), and JavaScript dictates their behavior.

## The Evolution of JavaScript
- Once considered a **toy language**, JavaScript now powers:
  - **Front-end** (React, Vue, Angular)
  - **Back-end** (Node.js)
  - **Full-stack development**

## JavaScript's Popularity
- According to **RedMonk (2018)**, JavaScript remains the **most popular programming language**.
- Recommended for:
  - **iOS apps** → Swift
  - **Android apps** → Java/Kotlin
  - **Web development** → JavaScript
